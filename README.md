# track gender classifier

This repository represents a study on classifying the gender of music tracks based on their audio features.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the gender of a track's artist using various audio characteristics.

The raw data is sourced in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs), which provides a rich set of audio features for each track.
